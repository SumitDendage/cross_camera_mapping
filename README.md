# cross_camera_mapping
This project performs real-time player detection, tracking, and identity mapping across two camera feeds (e.g., broadcast and tacticam views) using YOLOv11, color histogram feature extraction, and cosine similarity with Hungarian algorithm. Ideal for sports analytics and multi-camera surveillance systems.
